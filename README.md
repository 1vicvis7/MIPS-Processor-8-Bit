# MIPS-Processor-8-Bit
Hi friends ðŸ˜‰!!,

This is my project using regarding working of MIPS processor.
- This is a mimic of the actual MIPS implementations comprising all necessary elements included in the datapath.
- The datapath includes, Register file, Instruction Memory, Control Unit, Data Memory. 
- Since here, memories are different, it is a Von neuman Architecture style implementation.

Hope this finds some help to you all!! :raised_hands
  Thank you!! ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
